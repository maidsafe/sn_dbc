//! This module defines blstrs aliases

//! We provide type aliases to make the usage in each context clearer and to make the
//! the sn_dbc public API simpler so that the caller should not need to depend on blstrs
//! and use its types directly.
//!
//! sn_dbc internally uses the type aliases rather than directly using the blstrs types.
